The Campaign Management project
***********************************

Campaign Management is related to Android Experimentation which in turn is related to the SmartSantander research project, aiming to provide an Android smartphone application augmenting the functionality of an existing Future Internet infrastructure. 

The difference from Android Experimentation is in the WebService concept. Where A.E. uses static jsp, the Campaign Manegament uses the spring framework to handle the added functionalities.
